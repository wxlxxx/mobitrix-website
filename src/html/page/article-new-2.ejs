        <h3>Is it Possible to Transfer WhatsApp from Google Drive to iCloud Directly?</h3>
        <p>It is currently not possible to transfer WhatsApp from Google drive to iCloud directly (But we have solutions to work it out).</p>
        <p>Google Drive is one of the best ways to back up WhatsApp messages on Android devices. But Google Drive’s encryption protocols are vastly different from iCloud, making the transfer of WhatsApp data from Google Drive to iCloud directly impossible. But it is worth pointing out that there are third-party tools that can help you bridge this gap, allowing you to easily transfer WhatsApp data from the Google Drive backup to iCloud.</p>
        <div class="text-center">

        </div>
        <h3>How to Properly Do It</h3>
        <p>The transfer of WhatsApp from Google Drive to iCloud can be accomplished in phases. The first phase involves restoring the backup to the Android device. In phase 2 we will use a special third-party tool to transfer the restored data to an iOS device before backing up the data to iCloud.</p>
        <p>Here’s how to complete this process in more detail.</p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
          <li><a href="">1st Phase. Restore WhatsApp from Google Drive to Android First
          <li><a href="">2nd Phase. Then Transfer WhatsApp from Android to iPhone</a></li>
          <li><a href="">3rd Phase. Transfer iPhone to WhatsApp to iCloud</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>1st Phase. Restore WhatsApp from Google Drive to Android First</h3>
        <p>The first thing to do when you want to move WhatsApp backup from Google Drive to iCloud is to restore WhatsApp from Google Drive to Android first. Here’s how to do it.</p>
        <p><span class="text-primary">Step 1</span>: Begin by uninstalling WhatsApp on your Android device and then reinstall it.</p>
        <p><span class="text-primary">Step 2</span>: Open WhatsApp on the device and then follow the on-screen prompts to set up WhatsApp and confirm the phone number. It is important that you use the same phone number that you used to create the backup.</p>
        <p><span class="text-primary">Step 3</span>: Click on “Restore” when prompted in the next window to restore the backup.</p>
        <p><span class="text-primary">Step 4</span>: When the restoring process is complete, tap “Next” to continue setting up WhatsApp.</p>
        <div class="text-center">

        <p><strong>Requirements before Restoring from Google Drive: </strong></p>
        <p>There are some requirements that you should know before restoring from Google drive.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="text-primary">Sufficient storage</span>: Google drive enables you to keep lots of data. The restoring prcess may end up if there is no enough storage on Google drive.</li>
          <li><span class="text-primary">An activated phone</span>: You need to activate your phone with your own email addres and password.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2nd Phase. Then Transfer WhatsApp from Android to iPhone</h3>
        <p>The next step in our process is to transfer the restored WhatsApp data to the iPhone. For this we need a specialized tool that can move WhatsApp data between devices even if the devices run on different platforms. The best tool for this purpose is <span class="text-primary">Mobitrix WhatsApp Transfer</span>. Its main advantage is to transfer all WhatsApp data between Android and iPhone.</p>

        <p><span class="text-primary">Step 1</span>:  Ensure that the iPhone is connected to a Wi-Fi network and that it is also adequately charged. Open the Settings on your iPhone and tap on your name. Scroll down to locate “iCloud” and tap on it.</p>
